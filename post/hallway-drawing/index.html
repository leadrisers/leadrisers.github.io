-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=hallway-drawing-by-silentnight745-on-deviantart>Hallway Drawing By Silentnight745 On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hallway-drawing-by-silentnight745-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://img00.deviantart.net/4090/i/2007/021/1/e/hallway_drawing_by_silentnight745.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.vkjT1nF0GEWz9s8DJHcw2AHaE_&pid=15.1"' alt="Hallway drawing by silentnight745 on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: silentnight745.deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>hallway.</p></blockquote><p>What is anime and why are people interested in it?
