-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=chibi--winks--peace-sign--by-xallaboutx-on-deviantart>Chibi [ Winks + Peace Sign ] By XAllaboutx On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chibi--winks--peace-sign--by-xallaboutx-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://orig11.deviantart.net/8cad/f/2012/060/3/c/chibi___winks___peace_sign___by_xallaboutx-d4rek68.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.NpTRzXtIf6Ny97hmPUhk4QHaF8&pid=15.1"' alt="Chibi [ winks + peace sign ] by xAllaboutx on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: xallaboutx.deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>winks.</p></blockquote><p>What are the benefits of cool wallpaper?
